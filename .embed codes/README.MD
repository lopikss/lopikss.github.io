# Ruffle Embed Code

Embed Flash games into your own website no downloads or browser extensions required.  

All features will work by **only changing the game link at the top of the code**.  
Everything else will adapt automatically.  


## Recommended Version
If you’re new to HTML, you may want to start with **`OLD_EasyRuffleEmbedCode.html`**.  
> ⚠️ Note: This version is very outdated, even more so than `OLD_RuffleEmbedCode.html`.  
> - `OLD_RuffleEmbedCode.html` is still maintained and should work as long as Ruffle does.  
> - The “OLD_” prefix is only there because the improved version is now in `index.html`.
